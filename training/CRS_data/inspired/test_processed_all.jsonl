Recommender: Have you ever heard of Stephen King? Haha, you said you like horror so that might be a silly question. I forgot about his movies but those were some of my favorites growing up. If you like him, I actually have some really good recommendations. Seeker: Bruh. Stephen King is like my favorite author of all time after Orwell. Recommender: Hahaha that's crazy. I love Stephen King, and I love Orwell's 1984. That's crazy. I also think they did a decent job of turning King's books into movies. Which movies based on his books have you seen? I'll know which one to not recommend based on that. Seeker: 1984 is my exact favorite book actually... As for the King movies IT (Both the 90's one and the remake), Cat's Eye (I think that was him), Pet Cemetery one and two (From back in the day)... Gosh it's been awhile. Gerald's Game. There were a few others but they were all years ago. Fun fact: He used to due the Stan Lee thing where he stuck himself into the movies as a cameo. Recommender: That's crazy. 1984 stuck with me for a long time and influenced me a lot. And that is a good fun fact about King hahaha. Now i'm going to have to look that up.

Seeker: I've seen a few that I really liked. What kind of movies are you into? I'm a horror and comedy fan myself. Recommender: I love horror and comedy. I also like action, and recently I have really enjoyed documentaries. Which horror movie is your favorite? Seeker: That's a tough one. Honestly I'm a huge fan of earlier horror. I like the new stuff but Nightmare on Elm Street, Wishmaster and Hellraiser.. That era will always be my favorite. See any good ones recently? I've been looking for more modern horror. Recommender: I really like those too. I agree that the new ones aren't bad, but nothing beats the classics. Wow, that makes me think of a couple that you'd probably be interested in because of what you said. Do you like sequels at all? Seeker: Oh heck yeah. I would argue that Nightmare on Elm Street 3 was the best of the whole bunch. And the remake for IT was downright terrifying. Recommender: I know. I also liked the Halloween series. I thought that some of the ones from the 80s were actually better than ones in the 70s. Do you recall who wrote the nightmare on Elm street movies because that'd help me make a recommendation. I think that made a movie recently you'd be interested in Seeker: It was Wes Craven. Love that guys work. Sure they were a little campy but It was the way of things at the time.

I love action films and all the Terminator movies Recommender: I love those as well. Have you heard about Bad Boys 3 coming out this Jan with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. It's got plenty of action and long overdue for part 3. Seeker: No I've never heard of that, what's the story line? Recommender: Well you'll definitely have to catch up on the other 2. It's about two cops in Miami who are best friends. Ones a more tied down family man and the other is a big time playboy who like to live the lavish life. Although they both live completely different lifestyles, they work really well together. It's a very grounded buddy cop movie with plenty of action and comedy. A hit sequel came out and now after many years a third is going to be released in January. Seeker: Well I better watch the first two before that one comes out! Recommender: Since you enjoy action films have you heard and seen the fast and furious franchise? Seeker: Yeah I have seen those. I kind of like corny 80's action movies more Recommender: Say no more. Are you more of a Stallone? Van Damme? or Scharzenegger fan? Seeker: Definitely Schwarzenegger Recommender: So I got two awesome choices you can tell me, which you prefer to hear more about. His awesome 80s hit Predator or Last Action Hero? Although the second one came in the very early 90's I still have to add that because it's very underrated. Seeker: I've seen both of those! This is hard! Recommender: The great thing about 80s films is you can go back and rewatch them so many times and still enjoy it. I forgot to mention his other hit Total Recall! Its such a great 80s film demonstrating his cheesy yet entertaining acting. Set in the future as a regular working guy, he decides to enter a virtual world type place where he lives a fantasy life of a secret agent. Things go haywire in the process that lead to a crazy action adventure on Mars. Seeker: Oh I haven't seen that one! I'll definitely give that one a look.", "rec": [], "resp": "You won't regret it!

It is really good and will keep you on you seats edge for the whole movie. but if you are looking to stay in and rent or stream a good movie i would go with terminator dark fury or fast and furious hobbs and shaw. both of these movies are very good and will keep you well entertained . Seeker: I'm definitely interested in the Terminator franchise. I'll go with that pick. Recommender: You will not regret it ! it has the return of the original Sarah Conner ( well the lady who played her in the very first movie, Linda Hamilton i believe is her name), as well as Arnold as the terminator that has aged thru time who has stayed to make sure things stay on track for the human race and sky net never rises. plus the new terminators are awesome!!! the graphics and effects are next level for sure Seeker: Is her son in this version of the movie as well? (The co-star of Terminator 2) Recommender: yes he is, i didnt wanna spoil it!! Seeker: How do they address ageing the terminator? Seems like an odd thing for robots to do.

It was a sci-fi movie with a lot of deeper meanings. I have always liked movies that have to do with the future, especially ones that deal in psychology and human behavior. Recommender: Great movie!

Recommender: Do you like movies with a lot of action in them, or one that are more focused on the story and build up of events? Seeker: I like ones that are more focused on the story and events. I like very complex storylines. Recommender: I think I have the perfect movie for you. Do you enjoy a movie that you want to re-watch after its over because the ending was so unexpected?
