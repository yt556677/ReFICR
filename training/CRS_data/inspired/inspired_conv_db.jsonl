            "30 days of night is definitely a good one. What are some other horror movies you've enjoyed recently?",
            "I saw Fantasy Island just the other day. It was surprisingly good, even though the reviews have said otherwise. I actually run a horror movie podcast for international horror movies. Just recently we spoke about Under the Shadow, a horror movie on Netflix. Amazing movie. I wanted to go see Brahms 2, but I'm worried it is going to be a waste of money. I also saw The Grudge (the one that came out this year). It was so bad it was funny. lol",
            "Haha I can certainly see finding good humor in The Grudge. If you like so terrible its funny types of films, Phantasm was definitely one of my favorites. Definitely over the top, and the special effects were just absolutely icing on the cake. It's a great one if you're into the older films as well. Another I can recommend that was a bit more on the serious side... have you seen Midsommer?",
            "I have heard of Phantasm but haven't seen, it, but it is on the list. Love the so terrible its funny type! Just went to a midnight showing of The Room, and got to meet Tommy Wiseau!! If you love those types of movies, that is definitely one of the best. I did see Midsommar! It was sooooooo interesting. Very twisty, very weird, right up my odd alley. LOL. Phantasm just jumped to the top of my list today!!",
            "That's awesome! The first one is very 70's old horror flick. I watched it as a teenager, and still remember how so-bad-but-funny it was even ten years later. I'm so glad we could find a good one for you to add to the list!",

But I found that one to be absolutely tasteful, not overly done at all for what they had in it! May I also recommend more of a suspense film that is a little more on the side of ghosts and hauntings than vampires?",

            "Not sure if it was the original or not, but it was the musical one. I actually liked it very mucn but I like musicals. They don't have many of those anymore. Mama Mia was good! Like most movies they should quit while they are ahead because the second one wasn't so good. Same thing happened with Grease.",

            "It did not have the original cast and the music just didn't have a spark."

            "I saw that one and was kind of disappointed, it's a lot more style than substance."

The humor can be found in the expectation of proper etiquette yet, the rude manner it can be delivered. A great place to learn proper ways of socializing.",
            "I just watched a small trailer for the movie EMMA that you suggested, I can indeed see many of the elements you mentioned being in the movie. It looks like it would be a wonderful watch with a close friend of mine, i think we will put this on our to do list! I know we both would quite enjoy the humor in this show just from the brief trailer I saw.",
            "Great! Another movie is An Ideal Husband. This was a play written by Oscar Wilde turned into a movie. He is also the author of the play, The Importance of Being",
            "Oh, I have not heard of either of those either. I will do some researching on An Ideal Husband as well.Being from the same writer I am certain I would be interested in seeing more of their work.",

            "I just watched a trailer for An Ideal Husband this looks like another good suggestion, also The importance of being Ernest sounds very familiar, I know I have heard of that before, thank you for that suggestion too.",
            "You are welcome",
            "An Ideal Husband is from 1999, and has many familiar faces of actors I have seen in other films over the years. I am shocked I don't recall watching it, but it also seems a good watch with my friend I mentioned previously. I tend to do movie nights often with a close friend, and we are always looking for new things to watch, I know she would like these.",
            "Yes...I agree. The play on our social scenes versus early England society is wonderful. We are still the same except they hid their misdoings while we are more relaxed about shortcomings.",
            "I agree with you, it's nice to be able to find comedy in such things, nothing better than enjoying a nice laugh and a good story. Especially with loved ones!"

It's great if you want to learn more about Japanese culture. It's on Netflix. Thanks for the film recommendation of The Exception. I will check it out."

It actually gives me more reasons to stay inside and watch more movies I have fallen behind on. I just got done watching Contagion last night. What kind of movies and stuff do you watch?",
            "Haha that is funny you mention Contagion, I also just watched thay because of all this craziness. I usually like a solid, creative plot - also I do like scifi as well but not superhero movies. I am exhausted of superhero movies.",
            "I can't say I blame you about the superhero thing they have kind of beaten that one into the ground. I am glad you like Sci-FI! I do too! Have you ever seen I am Legend with Will Smith? I thought it was really well done and loved Will Smith and his struggle with being alone and trying to deal with his own depression while trying to survive it all!",
            "Actually no I haven't but I really like Will Smith and that sounds like a plot I would enjoy. I was also looking for a recommendation to watch for later tonight. I also enjoy watching a character go through the hero's journey, if you will, so it sounds like i'll check that out! I approve of that recommendation and thank you for the advice!",
            "Of course! I think you will love it especially with you liking Sci-Fi and strong plot lines. Maybe check check out the trailer and get a preview of what you are getting into. Bring snacks and a friend to hold onto lol. There are some pretty intense moments and some really sad ones too. I am glad you have a plan for the night now. Would you like to watch this Trailer?",
            "Yeah I think there aren't many actors who can hold a movie alone but Will Smith definitely can. I will! I'll make sure to watch the trailer first. Thanks again. Yes, I would like to watch this trailer.",
            "Of course mate. Please enjoy it I have seen it like 5 times or more haha. It'll absolutely hold your attention and Mr. Smith is awesome. Have a great rest of your day and I hope my advise leads you to another classic you love. Take Care, J",

            "Suicide Squad was garbage. Honestly i would try and look at this movie detached from the batman franchise completely. Even tho its does have easter eggs for those fans this is way to good to even lump with them. If you're familiar with Joaquin Phoenix expect a quality that only he can achieve. It a performance for sure. Not like health ledger way more real.",

Is this movie friendly for the more religious side of ones family? I have a few Zealots and want to know what too expect so I can stave off their constant state of being offended lol.",

            "I have watched Kevin Hart for years and the more he does, the more I love him. I thought his chemistry with Dwayne Johnson on screen was brilliant. Are you looking for a movie with a similar story line? Or would you like to switch it up?",

            "Wonderful! I'm happy to hear we are on the same page. I think I have a solid understanding of what you like. Do you like longer or shorter movies?",

            "The hunger Games series is one of my favorites. It is a little bit of an older film, the first movie having been released in 2012, but I think this series accurately depicts what you are looking for in a movie. Would you like to hear more about it?",
            "I've always wanted to check the series out i definitely will now!",
            "I definitely think it's a great choice. There are several in the series. The original movie was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. Would you like to look at any of the other movies in the series?",

            "Great! I recommend starting with the first film. The duration is only 142 minutes, so it won't take up your whole afternoon that way you can still have time to decide if you want to get the other movies in the series.",
