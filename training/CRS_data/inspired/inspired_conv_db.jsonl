When you have a GF, you tend to see a lot of movies. Seeker: I am married and have two kids ages 2 and 4 so of course I was wondering what would be suitable out there for them Recommender: Do you have a particular genre in mind? Horror, comedy, etc... Seeker: It would be a like atleast 1.5-2 hour max and a kids movie rated g Recommender: Well, the obvious choice is A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. It's about Mr. Rogers. Seeker: Do we know how long that movie is Recommender: Its an hour and a half, so it should hit your sweet spot. Seeker: That would be good. Do you have any ideas on what other movies are around that amount of time and are animated? Recommender: For animation there is Playmobil: The Movie Seeker: Oh nice. What is that one about? Recommender: It abourt the building toy, Playmobil. Its made for kids so its only an hour and a half too. Seeker: That is a good recommendation. You know how kids are my concern was making sure they were interested in the movie because it can be hard to sit through one Recommender: You can't go wrong with either one. I would probably recommend the first one, but that's from an adult perspective. Unless the kids are into Mr Rogers, Playumobil should hit the spot for them best. Seeker: I remember Mr rogers when I was a kid it would be nice to share that with my kids Recommender: Yeah, me too. He was a very interesting guy. Seeing the film might make the kids get into him. Seeker: That is true. I think Tom hanks will do a good job in that one Recommender: Yeah. If you like Hanks and want something for the kids thats not too long, then this is the one. Reviews were great too. Seeker: Thank you for your recommendation. I will choose Mr Rogers",

Seeker: That's great, I love documentaries! It's fun to learn and be entertained at the same time. What's your favorite? Recommender: Well, even though I'm young in age, I do think older documentaries are still the best that has been done. Even though I would not classify this documentary as fun in a joyful manner, it is informative about a serious topic, the Holocuast. The documentary is called Shoah. Seeker: That sounds very difficult to watch but interesting. Is it about a specific person who lived through the Holocaust, or a more general documentary? Recommender: A general documentary about how the whole process of genocide against European Jews was carried. The unique thing about it is that it does not rely on a single piece of film from the 1930s or 1940s. The director, a French man travels to different parts of Europe, including the sites where the concentration camps once stood, and interviews the bystanders that saw their neighbors being removed. He also includes the input of prominent historians. Seeker: That sounds really interesting! One would have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it I imagine, but the interviews sound fascinating and disturbing. Thanks for the info, I accept your recommendation! Recommender: Although I forgot to mention a very important fact about the documentary that deters people from watching, It has to be seen on different sittings because it runs close to 9.5 hours, which I think reflects the seriousness of the subject is addressing. Seeker: That doesn't sound bad, I just watched the Ken Burns PBS documentary, which is 10+ hours I believe. I really enjoyed it. Have you watched any of his documentaries?

It is subtitled, obviously, but as a film buff I do check lists that come out in which critics rank their favorite movies and Shoah consistently ranks as one of the best, if not the best, documentary of all time. Seeker: I'm not much of a film buff, but always happy to check out some films from before my time that I may have overlooked! Another good one that the critics also seem to like is Hoop Dreams, have you seen that? Recommender: Unfortunately no, I had not even heard of it. As you mentioned liking historically accurate, I do enjoy those as well. Although they might not be presented from the viewpoint of an important figure, they usually revolve around a important event like The Biggest Short with Ryan Gosling, Steve Carrell and Christian Bale. It presents a point of view about what led to the 2008 economic crash. Seeker: I did enjoy the Biggest Short. I enjoy Revolutionary War ere history but haven't found any great documentaries on that yet. John Adams miniseries on HBO was pretty good for a drama though. Recommender: How about earlier movies about earlier periods like the 1500s? Seeker: I'm not very familiar with that time period unfortunately. I know a little bit about some of the explorers but that's about it. Any recommendations?",

Recommender: Thats good! So we know you don't want anything too dirty and raunchy. What type of stipulations do you have pertaining to action and romantic comedies? Seeker: That's pretty much it. I also like movies based around World War II. Though I know those genres typically do not overlap necessarily. Do you have any recommendations for those genres? Recommender: I might have a title or two. You were right about those two genre's not exactly blending well or very often, but rest assured it does happen! How do you feel about Bette Midler and James Caan? Seeker: I had to google James Caan. Ha! I like both of them a lot. I have yet to see a movie featuring Bette Midler that I did not enjoy. Recommender: Ha! You can never go wrong with Ms. Midler. I think The First Wives Club is one of my all time favorites. Midler and Hawn make an excellent team! Seeker: I have yet to watch that movie. I remember seeing the trailer for it all the time when I watched an old VHS of A Very Brady Sequel, but I have yet to actually see it. Recommender: Well I think I may have the perfect movie for you. There are strong comedic elements, its set during World War 2 and starring....Bette Midler! Seeker: That does sound pretty perfect! Recommender: I thought so! Its one of my favorites. Something I watch when I'm feeling nostalgic as it was released in 1991. Bette Midler and James Caan make an excellent team and of course, since it is set during WWII, you'll want to have some tissues handy. Seeker: I appreciate that warning. I am definitely a crier! Haha! Recommender: Oh, there's nothing wrong with having a good cry every now and then! It's good for the soul. Its a painless way to release pent up emotions. At least that's what I tell myself. Seeker: I would think you right since I tell myself the same thing and I'm a Social Work major in college.;) Recommender: Oh my. So you already HAD the tissues on hand!

But you've got Farce, Dark Comedy, Romantic Comedy, Action Comedy and such types of Parodies. Which one would you be more open to seeing? Seeker: I like stand up comedy as well, but I prefer it to not have a lot of profanity or explicit content. I love action comedies and romantic comedies. Same stipulations though. Recommender: Thats good! So we know you don't want anything too dirty and raunchy. What type of stipulations do you have pertaining to action and romantic comedies? Seeker: That's pretty much it. I also like movies based around World War II. Though I know those genres typically do not overlap necessarily. Do you have any recommendations for those genres? Recommender: I might have a title or two. You were right about those two genre's not exactly blending well or very often, but rest assured it does happen! How do you feel about Bette Midler and James Caan? Seeker: I had to google James Caan. Ha! I like both of them a lot. I have yet to see a movie featuring Bette Midler that I did not enjoy. Recommender: Ha! You can never go wrong with Ms. Midler. I think The First Wives Club is one of my all time favorites. Midler and Hawn make an excellent team! Seeker: I have yet to watch that movie. I remember seeing the trailer for it all the time when I watched an old VHS of A Very Brady Sequel, but I have yet to actually see it. Recommender: Well I think I may have the perfect movie for you. There are strong comedic elements, its set during World War 2 and starring....Bette Midler! Seeker: That does sound pretty perfect! Recommender: I thought so! Its one of my favorites. Something I watch when I'm feeling nostalgic as it was released in 1991. Bette Midler and James Caan make an excellent team and of course, since it is set during WWII, you'll want to have some tissues handy. Seeker: I appreciate that warning. I am definitely a crier! Haha! Recommender: Oh, there's nothing wrong with having a good cry every now and then! It's good for the soul. Its a painless way to release pent up emotions. At least that's what I tell myself. Seeker: I would think you right since I tell myself the same thing and I'm a Social Work major in college.;) Recommender: Oh my. So you already HAD the tissues on hand! Well it's a good thing then cause I know for a fact this movie has squeezed some tears out of me, no matter how great of a mood I was in when I started watching it. Seeker: Well the anticipation is killing me! Ha! So what is the movie? Recommender: The movie is called 'For the Boys', and I really do think you'll like it, if not love it. Its moving and touching in all the right ways! Seeker: Well that sounds like a dream. Can you tell me a little about the plot? I like to have at least a little information to mentally and emotionally prepare myself.",

There is even a new animated movie called Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse that subverts the traditional story by skipping most of it. It would be a fun option to pair with the Tom Holland versions for comparison. Seeker: Ok, I think I have heard of that too. Spider Gwen is in it. I will check that out too!",

Recommender: I do. I like the classic horror movies such as Scream and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I like being scared when I watch movies. However, I just don't find them scary.I think stories are the most important part to a movie, however others I talk to seem to disagree.What about you, what do you value the most when it comes to movies? Seeker: I agree with you that the stories are the main ingredient in a movie. What horror movies have good stories. And can we please move this a little faster. Recommender: I would recommend Get Out. Would you be interested in that? Seeker: OOOO im totally afraid of that one. It seems like a very serious movie. Is there like an intro type of horror movie for peeps such as myself? Recommender: How about Split? Its about a man with 23 personalities that kidnaps 3 girls. It was my first horror movie. It's more of a thriller and not so much a gore fest. Or, the original 80's IT is pretty good as well. It's quite a long one, but it is a good story. It's also not quite as scary as many of the other horror movies. Would you be interested in either of these? Seeker: They sound interesting and totally worth the look. What other kinds of movies are you interested in? I'm a 56 yr old man so I can get into some of the older movies. Especially comedies! Have any favorites? Recommender: I don't watch comedies as much as horror movies, but my favorite would probably South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut. It's a musical but all the songs are amazing. I remember when I was a kid I watched it with my mom, and we still quote it every day several years later! On top of that, its a great commentary on censorship, commentary that still holds up 20 years later. Would you be interested in that? Seeker: I love south park and another slam dunk! Its fun to watch someones commentaries on current events with a little comedy in its thread. I did like the Mel Brooks movies in the day. I remember my Father and I laughing till it hurt watching those movies. So is there a movie that you like which is a blend between horror and comedy? Recommender: I guess the old 80's IT would be an example of that. It was never intended to be a comedy. But watching it today, you're sure to get a good laugh at Pennywise! Seeker: I understand what you mean. I look at the old James Bond movies and laugh on how fake the fight scense look. Is there a fight scene you like in a particular movie? Recommender: I don't really watch movies with fight scenes. So you would want to watch IT? Seeker: Sure I will give it a try. Keeping the remote nearby!",

Recommender: Have you seen the movie Wonder? It is a about a boy who had facial differences that didn't allow him to go to a normal school, and as other people around him struggle, he is the glue who holds it all once he gets into the fifth grade Seeker: I have heard about the book. Haven't watched the movie. From details it looks very emotional. Does the movie have humor element? Recommender: It has a slight humor taste but nothing major. Is that what you look for when searching for a movie? Seeker: Slight humor works fine. Is it good to watch with kids? Recommender: I would say that it could be slightly emotional, but it is a great movie to watch with the family for sure. So many lessons taught and important ones too! Seeker: Ok. I accept this movie recommendation. Recommender: So would you like to watch the trailer? Seeker: Yes. before that do you have any other suggestion? Recommender: I definitely could. What are other things that you look for in movies? Seeker: some romantic new movies? Recommender: Ah sorry, I'm not too well endowed with Romantic movies. What other genres do you like? Seeker: one more family oriented movie. Recommender: Have you seen Incredibles or Incredibles 2? Definitely one that incorporates the whole family and is a blast to watch with kids. Action, with humor, and overall great. Seeker: no. I haven't. Is both the stories connected. Or like second part is continuation of the first part.?",

For example, have you heard of I Am Number Four? Seeker: Yes I like the Marvel heroes. Never heard of I am Number Four Recommender: Awesome! I am Number Four is an exciting and gripping movie about these persons that have powers called legacies. It is based off of a book series. The movie received a lot of good reviews from people that enjoy hero and action. Watching the film actually made me read the series. The trailer is here, if you want to check it out and let me know what you think! Seeker: How Many series are there?? And yes I can check the trailer. Recommender: This movie is based off of the first novel in a seven novel series! I really hope they make movies out of the sequels. This, in my opinion, was an underrated film. It isn't as crazy intricate as Marvel/DC movies are, but it definitely does have very exciting sequences and puts a nice little smile on your face at the end. The trailer can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_U6ctjOaic Seeker: OH wow the movie look very interesting, I wanna see it. Do you have any other recommendation? Recommender: Yes! Have you ever seen the movie Hancock with Will Smith? It is an awesome movie about a homeless superhero who doesn't know how to use his powers responsibly, and his growth as he becomes a better superhero. Seeker: Yeah I have seen That one. Recommender: Awesome! That was a fun movie. Speaking of fun, have you heard about the new Eddie Murphy comedy coming out? It is called Dolemite Is My Name. I am putting it up in a recommendation if you would like to check it out! Seeker: Yes i have heard of it. And yeah go ahead Recommender: Awesome! Historical films are a little bit tougher, since most of the recent historical films seem to all revolve around major wartime events, for example, the movie 1917 that is going to be releasing soon. However, I have a film you may be interested that isn't quite war based! There is a movie named The King that is available on Netflix! It has received some great reviews, especially for it's cinematography and beautiful camera shots. It has an impressive cast. Seeker: What is the movie (The King) about??",

Seeker: I've heard really good things about Joker. It may be a bit too dark for me. What is the plot about? Recommender: It pretty much shows how the Joker fit into society when he was trying to function as a normal human being, and it gives insight on his mental illness and background as a clown-like character. It is kind of dark, which definitely makes sense to his character. Seeker: Hm, sounds very interesting. I do like comic book movies as well. What is the plot of Zombieland 2? Recommender: Zombieland 2 is a sequel to Zombieland, where strangers are brought together as a survival team in the zombie apocalypse. The second movie shows them years later as they have grown into more of a family unit, and some drama threatens their relationship. Seeker: The plot sounds pretty scary and funny. Who stars in Zombieland 2? Recommender: Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin. Seeker: Wow, I really like Woody Harrelson's acting. That sounds like a good movie.

Movies like Lethal Weapon or Rush Hour where there's a lot of action, but also some great laugh lines. Recommender: There's a new Bad Boys coming out in January. The first two were very much in the Lethal Weapon/Rush Hour school of action. Seeker: Oh yeah! I remember seeing a couple of trailers for that. That's perfect. I accept this recommendation. Recommender: Excellent! I hope you enjoy the film. Seeker: Me too. Will Smith's been in a bunch of good movies lately, so hopefully this one's good too. Recommender: I'm looking forward to Spies in Disguise, his new animated movie. That could also be an action comedy, though I get more comedy than action. Seeker: Yeah, I feel like Spies in Disguise is more of a kids' movie. Not that that's a bad thing, just not quite my thing. Recommender: Did you see either of the previous Bad Boys movies? Seeker: Yes. I enjoyed them both. I think Bad Boys is a good recommendation. Recommender: What other types of movies do you enjoy? Seeker: Science fiction! Serenity, Star Trek, that sort of thing. Recommender: How do you feel about Star Wars? Seeker: Well, I have a son that we named Luke. Does that give you an idea?:) Recommender: Excellent choice of name! I'll take it you've already got Rise of Skywalker on your calendar Seeker: Definitely. The Last Jedi was pretty awful, but I'm hoping with JJ Abrams back at the helm, this one will be better. Recommender: The part that got me in that one was the Leia/Mary Poppins bit. Seeker: Lol, I hadn't thought of it that way. Now I won't be able to unthink it. Argh. For me it was mostly that the whole central conflict of the movie chase could have been avoided if Admiral Holdo wasn't a terrible commander. Recommender: Let's see what happens in this next one. Are you a Browncoat, by chance? Seeker: Is there any other good color? Recommender: Thoughts on a reboot of Firefly? Another sequel of sorts? Perhaps focusing on Kaylee? Seeker: I'd be skeptical at this point that they'd do it justice, but I'd be in. Recommender: Why the skepticism? I don't disagree, just curious to learn your thoughts on the matter Seeker: Just hard to catch lightning in a bottle like that. Especially since I don't think most of the original actors would be coming back at this point. Whole new cast and all that. But I'd be down with a prequel or reboot, sure.",

It is about the strength in family/sibling love. But, there are some great comedic moments as well. And, the music is really good. Seeker: Sounds interesting.

I still love you. I would recommend the second newer one, but since you haven't seen the first I would start by recommending that one. A high school girl writes letters to a bunch of her crushes.

Family movies such as Disney are always lovable. Funny you ask, I am actually looking for a recommendation. Recommender: Glad to hear! You should check out Shazam! It's very funny and fun and if you're a Disney fan definitely watch Toy Story 4. Seeker: Shazam was an awesome movie I must say. I would watch it again however i must accept your second recommendation of Toy Story 4. Those were amazing movies and I specifically like the first one the most. Although that is my stance, it may soon change after watching the 4th one. In my best Woody voice: Thanks partner Recommender: Also check out the comedy classic Groundhog Day, Bill Murray is great in it. Also, if the kids are pokemon fans give Detective Pikachu a chance. Seeker: Bill Murray is a very famous actor and has been in quite a few movies now. He is easily one of the greatest to do it. I have heard of Groundhog Day and maybe seen it before but wouldn't hurt to check it out. I have heard great things about that new movie detective Pikachu, I believe it has Ryan Reynolds as the main character of course other than Pikachu. Fun movie think that came out this year?",

Recommender: I'm not that familiar with comedies, but I've heard that Booksmart is a good one. Would you like to know more about it? Seeker: Sure, what's Booksmart about? Recommender: It's about two overachieving high school girls who decide to cram all the things they missed out on in high school into one night. Seeker: Whose it starring? This almost feels like a Melissa McCarthy role. Recommender: It's got Lisa Kudrow from friends! No Melissa McCarthy though, surprisingly. Seeker: Ooh, I like Lisa Kudrow. Haven't seen in her a movie yet. Recommender: Me neither! I think I need to watch this movie ASAP. Would you like to watch the trailer? Seeker: Yes. Sounds good. I'd like to see who she's starring along too. Recommender: Okay! I will show it to you when we're done chatting. It has a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes! Seeker: Oh! That's pretty high. Is it a holiday movie too? Recommender: Nope! Oh, and it has Carrie Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd from American Horror Story. Seeker: Oh good.

Sandler is really good in it and I think he got robbed by not getting nominated for an Oscar. The supporting characters are great as well, and Kevin Durant's role is not just a cameo, he is integral part of the story. Definitely recommend it. Seeker: I am curious. Good Time was suspenseful but I found myself very bored. Did you feel that way at all about Uncut Gems? What kind of tone did you get from it? Recommender: Not at all. It is dark for sure. It moves pretty fast, and Sandler is constantly going. It kind of made me nervous/anxious at times because some scenes are chaotic, but that is part of the narrative. I saw it with my family, husband and two early-twenties boys and we all really like it. Seeker: Good to know. That makes me more interested.

Another movie I loved was Uncut Gems with Adam Sandler. it is quite a departure from what you are used to seeing from Sandler. I also didn't see the ending coming from a mile away which I really appreciate. Seeker: I am aware of that one but have not seen it. I have been meaning to but the director's last movie Good Time was also well received and I hated it so I have been unsure. Recommender: I would tell you to give it a shot. Sandler is really good in it and I think he got robbed by not getting nominated for an Oscar. The supporting characters are great as well, and Kevin Durant's role is not just a cameo, he is integral part of the story. Definitely recommend it. Seeker: I am curious. Good Time was suspenseful but I found myself very bored. Did you feel that way at all about Uncut Gems? What kind of tone did you get from it? Recommender: Not at all. It is dark for sure. It moves pretty fast, and Sandler is constantly going. It kind of made me nervous/anxious at times because some scenes are chaotic, but that is part of the narrative. I saw it with my family, husband and two early-twenties boys and we all really like it. Seeker: Good to know. That makes me more interested. Did you know who any of the other actors were because he is the only one I have heard anything about? Recommender: Yes. Indina Manzel (sp?) is his wife and Judd Hirsh is his father-in-law. The other actors are people who I have seen in other things, but don't know them by name but you will recognize them. Seeker: I am familiar with them. Judd Hirsh is a very good actor. Recommender: Absolutely....all the way back to his Taxi days! Yes, I am that old! Seeker: Ha ha. I'm somewhere in between. I saw it when I was very, very young.",

I tend to get annoyed if movies try to push too hard on a political agenda. Recommender: It's about the opposite. 2 officers are shot in NY and the 21 bridges surrounding the city are shut down as the fugitives are on the run. Seeker: Oh, wow. I never really would have thought it would have been the opposite. Interesting. Is it a true story or just fiction? Recommender: It's fiction. And I had the plot a little bit backwards. 2 fugitives are on the run. 7 officers are killed. Chadwick Boseman stars as the lead detective which is a cool tie to your love of Marvel type movies!

Jack has to face an army of foes that he thought existed only in legend, but through his arduous fight for the kingdom and its people, he may win the love of a brave princess, perhaps becoming a legend himself.

Seeker: I think I would prefer something along the lines of Japanese animated films. They are more adult and care more for the story then politics. Recommender: I see. Have you seen the new Men in Black International movie that came out recently. There's comedy and sci-fi for you. Seeker: Yes didn't like it. I want a Japanese animated film to watch.",

Recommender: It's also really good. There's a bit more blood in that one, but only briefly. And it isn't like the gory slasher kind of blood scene Seeker: Is it more sci-fi? Or detective? Recommender: So maybe a little more sci-fi, but not too much. The setting of the movie is after some disease has unfortunately wiped out most of the population. There is no real form of government, so people are looking after themselves and looking out for potential threats (mostly from other people trying to survive). But it's really more so from the perspective of this very shielded/protected teenager Seeker: Oh, that sounds good too. I have watched a couple of other virus type movies like that. Survival and everything...they're good. Thanks for the recommendations. I'm going to check out both of those. That's awesome.",

It is a bit older than the first one I recommended, however, it is star-studded with Zac Efron and Adam Devine. It's almost a given that it will be another great movie to watch as Zac Efron steals hearts and Adam Devine has a huge comedian side to him. Super cute and funny to watch! Seeker: That's not too old. People give Zac Efron a lot of flack, but I think he's usually a good fit for a comedy. Recommender: Right? I agree as well, he actually is a versatile actor. I know Zac Efron is a great actor in most of the romantic comedies he's in. But he also shows multiple sides to him in some of his action and suspenseful movies. I think Zac Efron is underrated for the wrong reasons. Seeker: I've seen Adam Devine in Why Him? which honestly was one of the funniest movies I've seen.",

Did the movie have different names in different markets? Recommender: yes, live, die, repeat was the movie's tagline, but went by that name in other markets. in a twist (for tom cruise at least), he initially doesnt know how to fight and hes trained by emily blunt Seeker: lol. That sounds like a good movie for me to check out. I accept your recommendation. Do you have any others?

I LOVE horror moview Recommender: Thats awesome! What kind of horror movies do you like? Something more suspense/thriller? Vampire/Supernatural? Gore? Seeker: I love supernatural, vampires are always good too. One of my favorites of all time was 30 days of night. I also like movies that can surprise me. Ones that I think I know the tropes, and something crazy comes out of left field Recommender: 30 days of night is definitely a good one. What are some other horror movies you've enjoyed recently? Seeker: I saw Fantasy Island just the other day. It was surprisingly good, even though the reviews have said otherwise. I actually run a horror movie podcast for international horror movies. Just recently we spoke about Under the Shadow, a horror movie on Netflix. Amazing movie. I wanted to go see Brahms 2, but I'm worried it is going to be a waste of money. I also saw The Grudge (the one that came out this year). It was so bad it was funny. lol Recommender: Haha I can certainly see finding good humor in The Grudge. If you like so terrible its funny types of films, Phantasm was definitely one of my favorites. Definitely over the top, and the special effects were just absolutely icing on the cake. It's a great one if you're into the older films as well. Another I can recommend that was a bit more on the serious side... have you seen Midsommer? Seeker: I have heard of Phantasm but haven't seen, it, but it is on the list. Love the so terrible its funny type! Just went to a midnight showing of The Room, and got to meet Tommy Wiseau!! If you love those types of movies, that is definitely one of the best. I did see Midsommar! It was sooooooo interesting. Very twisty, very weird, right up my odd alley. LOL. Phantasm just jumped to the top of my list today!! Recommender: That's awesome! The first one is very 70's old horror flick. I watched it as a teenager, and still remember how so-bad-but-funny it was even ten years later. I'm so glad we could find a good one for you to add to the list! Seeker: I appreciate it! I definitely appreciate the recommendation and I can't wait to watch it! Thank you so much! I enjoyed the chat! Recommender: For sure! Are there any other kinds of movies you'd like recommendations for? I have a few more horror-esque flicks as well if you're interested! Seeker: I'm definitely interested in a few more horro-esque recommendations! Im always up for expanding the list. I'm going to a horror film fest in June, and I want to expand my library quickly:-) Recommender: Have you ever seen Cursed? Christina Ricci, werewolf movie! Not too great ratings, but I love how they did the werewolves in that. I wish they'd have used similar styles to translate to other popular films! Seeker: I haven't!! I think I remember seeing commercials for it, or maybe it was an article online. I think Ive learned I cant trust ratings. That is going on my list to watch tonight too! Im curious to see what you mean about the werewolves. That's something that is always such a hit or miss for me. I do love the werewolves in What We Do In The Shadows though! Two great recommendations!! Awesome!! Thanks so much! Recommender: It's definitely a little cheesy, but for the time of release on the movie, I feel like the werewolf CGI was pretty well done. And, I gotta throw this one out there for you as well, have you seen Queen of the Damned? Those vampires are something else for sure! Seeker: I have!! Its one of my favorites:-) I see we have very similar tastes. Any other vampire ones you like?",

I didn't think I'd like it as I am, honestly, very reserved about gore in horror films and am not a fan. But I found that one to be absolutely tasteful, not overly done at all for what they had in it! May I also recommend more of a suspense film that is a little more on the side of ghosts and hauntings than vampires? Seeker: Interesting. Another one I haven't seen that piques my curiosity. Yes please, what is the suspense film that you think I would like?",

This particular one also got 6 nominations. I am sure that sequel is going to....kill....in the box office. Seeker: I liked the Paranormal Activity movies too. They made a bunch of sequels, and they were all reasonably good and not just a box office cash grab. Recommender: Those are pretty fantastic. I watched the first two alone in my bedroom with the lights off. They had me looking around the room thinking stuff was moving.

Recommender: Do you like Ben Stiller or Cameron Diaz? Seeker: I like them both! They both seem to have very sweet character portrayals. Recommender: If you haven't seen There's Something About Mary, I highly recommend it. It stars them both and it's really funny, some of the jokes can be a little bit dirty though. I can tell you more about it if you'd like. Seeker: I've heard some really good reviews about that one. I'd love to hear more about it. And I don't mind some of the dirty jokes, in the interest of comedy--I'll just be sure to watch it after the kids have gone to bed. I accept this recommendation. Tell me more about it, please. Recommender: Ben Stiller was a bit of a dork in high school and manages to get a prom date with a really attractive girl (Diaz), however the date goes awry in hilarious fashion. Years later he gets a chance to meet up with her again and kind of start over. Lots of complications though and the way he goes about it is kinda dodgy, but his heart is true. Seeker: So is the attractive girl nice or antagonistic in this movie? Does she seem to like Ben or does she treat him as though he's beneath her level. Recommender: She's actually super sweet and part of the reason she liked Ben's character in the beginning is because he had a sweet heart and got along well with her special needs brother. She's a bit of a guy's girl when she's older, into sports, beer, etc... Seeker: Cool--sounds interesting. I'd love to watch it. I accept your recommendation!",

What kind of movies do you like? Seeker: I love romantic comedies Recommender: Romantic comedies are awesome! Have you ever seen 500 Days of Summer? Seeker: Yeah. It was alright Recommender: That's one of my favorites. Which one is your current favorite? Seeker: We're the millers Recommender: I love Jennifer Aniston! Have you seen The Switch? Seeker: The switch was fantastic. Jenniefer was a revelation Recommender: I totally agree. I love Jason Bateman too, he's such a dad and absolutely hilarious. Have you seen Juno? Seeker: I haven't seen that one. What's it about? Recommender: It came out in like 2007 so it's a little older but it's about this teenage girl who accidentally gets pregnant by one of her best friends, and then how she deals with the aftermath of that. I don't want to spoil it and I know it sounds cheesy but it's actually really sweet and super funny and not at all what you would probably expect out of a teen pregnancy movie. Seeker: I'd really like to see it. It sounds interesting Recommender: Awesome! If you decide to watch it I hope you like it! Seeker: Do you have any other suggestion? Recommender: I also really like Crazy Stupid Love because Im a big Steve Carrell fan! It's about a guy having a sort of mid-life crisis after a divorce. Seeker: I've watched it.

Recommender: So you like more superhero and/or a decidedly good vs. evil kind of though provoking fantasy? Seeker: Doesn't have to have be good vs. evil, I also enjoy something with an interesting premise but doesn't throw it away in the middle of it. Recommender: Awesome, the movie that first came to mind and now stands out the most has definitely got to be Inception. It's all fantasy and really makes you think about how they're doing what they're doing in the movie. Seeker: Oh yeah that movie is great. Recommender: Christopher Nolan is definitely my favorite director because all of his movies are thriller type movies. Have you ever seen his movie The Prestige? Seeker: Not yet, but I'm intersted. Recommender: I thought it was a great movie. I'm not going to spoil anything for you. It's got so many good actors in it, Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Cane, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, and several more big name actors. Seeker: Alright I accept your recommendation. Recommender: I can't seem to find a trailer for this movie. Have you ever seen Memento, also directed by Christopher Nolan? Seeker: Huh, really? Well, not that one either, what is it about? Recommender: It's a mystery thriller about a man with amnesia, more or less.

I am always on edge Seeker: Yes I like foreign films if they are well done, I also like Amelie, which is a French film I believe Recommender: How about the movie The Girl in the Spiders Web, that might be of interest to you Seeker: Yes I have seen bits and pieces of it which I liked, but never managed to catch it on TV the whole way through.. Recommender: That may be your movie to see. I hope you enjoy it Seeker: Yes. Thank you! Recommender: I hope you enjoy the trailer Seeker: Do you have any comedy recommendations? I like Superbad and Knocked up. Recommender: A low down dirty shame would be awesome to watch Seeker: Okay. I have never heard of that. I also need some info on action movies. I like Die Hard 1 and 2. Recommender: Bruce Willis is the main character in both, It was a great hit that set his career on point. If you love action this is your go to movie Seeker: True. What about horror films? I have seen A nightmare on elm street, and I also liked Get Out which is more recent. Recommender: The Conjuring and The Shining. I promise you will not be disappointed Seeker: I loved the shining as well. I will have to check out The Conjuring. I have heard good things about it. Recommender: Would you like to see the Conjuring trailer? Seeker: Yes I would",

Recommender: As a Sci-fi fan, I had presumed that you had. You mentioned seeing the original trilogy multiple times, how do you think episodes I-III compare with the originals.

It is the 3rd sequel but you don't have to have seen the first two to watch this movie. Of course, as with most movies, there is a conflict for the agent and he has to do whatever it takes to protect the president. There is a LOT of action that I think you would like. I highly recommend it! Seeker: what about a really gory action movie Recommender: I would say this is fairly gory as a lot of people get blown up and there is a lot of hand to hand combat with stabbings and lots of shooting. Would you like to watch this movie trailer? Seeker: no i want a horror movie Recommender: Oh, I'm sorry. I apologize. I was thinking more action without the horror. How about Chainsaw Massacre?

It is a hilarious love story Seeker: i like comedy love stories. I will see about watching this soon Recommender: You wont regret it. It has Seth Rogan and Charlize Theron. It is easily one of the best movies I have seen all yearI love that it is a comedy and a romance.. Seeker: Any other recommendation Recommender: Good boys is another great comedy to see. Seeker: probably more cute than funny Recommender: Noooo Its hilarious. Its not what you think. I said the same thing. I laughed tears the entire time. Seeker: boys first kiss and the girl next door, cute and funny Recommender: Its almost like Superbad but with children. It really is a coming of age story about 12 year olds and what it is like growing up in todays times. It is about children but it is not a child movie. I'm actually laughing thinking about it. You wont be dissapointed. Another great movie to see right now is A beautiful day in the neighborhood- The Mr Rogers movie. Its nostalgic and I feel the best move of the year. Tom Hanks did an excellent job. Seeker: Ok interesting that it is of today children coming of age. I love Tom Hanks but not so sure if I could do Mr. Rogers",

What scary movie did you recently watch that made your dog watch the movie as well? Seeker: The most recent one I've noticed him watching was The Descent, which is kind of an older movie, but I watch it all the time at home. Recommender: Ive never watched that one myself. Is it really scary? I am a big fan of thrillers, like Stephen king movies. Seeker: I would say it's more of a thriller. There are some jump scares in it but it's not completely terrifying.

I love a good story no matter what it is. Seeker: I definitely have my genres I prefer watching, like comedy, rom-coms or dramas. Not a big thriller or horror movie person! I'll watch them, but I probably don't like it haha Recommender: I stay away from horror movies no matter what. They make me jumpy! What was the last good movie you have seen? Seeker: Honestly, I really like the Joker. Not a lot of people understood it and I feel like it was because they were expecting the Dark Knight Joker, rather than the real Joker himself. What about you? Recommender: I have watched a lot of movies. Recently, my favorite was The Green Book. I thought it had such a good story of friendship. Do you like indie films at all? Seeker: I do, but I haven't seen as many as I would l like! Do you have any recommendations? Recommender: Hmmm. Have you seen Last Christmas? I think you would enjoy it as it is a Rom-Com. Seeker: No I have not, and that's perfect for the Holidays! I will give Last Christmas a try :) Thank you! Recommender: Last Christmas Seeker: Last Christmas :) Thank you again Recommender: Oh you may also enjoy Knives Out. It is a mystery and has a great cast. It also had great reviews. Enjoy! Seeker: Awesome, I have been seeing trailers for it and it's caught my eye! Recommender: Are you a fan of any old movies? Seeker: Not particularly no. But I will take your two recommendations!",

Jane Eyre and The Little Women are also of that nature. Social issues and proper etiquette rule the show. The humor can be found in the expectation of proper etiquette yet, the rude manner it can be delivered. A great place to learn proper ways of socializing. Seeker: I just watched a small trailer for the movie EMMA that you suggested, I can indeed see many of the elements you mentioned being in the movie. It looks like it would be a wonderful watch with a close friend of mine, i think we will put this on our to do list! I know we both would quite enjoy the humor in this show just from the brief trailer I saw. Recommender: Great! Another movie is An Ideal Husband. This was a play written by Oscar Wilde turned into a movie. He is also the author of the play, The Importance of Being Seeker: Oh, I have not heard of either of those either. I will do some researching on An Ideal Husband as well.Being from the same writer I am certain I would be interested in seeing more of their work. Recommender: The Importance of Being Earnest is the play I mentioned. This play can be watched on YOUTUBE. You will find it interesting as a form of a movie/play. Seeker: I just watched a trailer for An Ideal Husband this looks like another good suggestion, also The importance of being Ernest sounds very familiar, I know I have heard of that before, thank you for that suggestion too. Recommender: You are welcome Seeker: An Ideal Husband is from 1999, and has many familiar faces of actors I have seen in other films over the years. I am shocked I don't recall watching it, but it also seems a good watch with my friend I mentioned previously. I tend to do movie nights often with a close friend, and we are always looking for new things to watch, I know she would like these. Recommender: Yes...I agree. The play on our social scenes versus early England society is wonderful. We are still the same except they hid their misdoings while we are more relaxed about shortcomings. Seeker: I agree with you, it's nice to be able to find comedy in such things, nothing better than enjoying a nice laugh and a good story. Especially with loved ones!",

Seeker: My favorite type of movie is romantic comedies and I do love movies that make me cry at some point in the story ;-) Recommender: I also like romantic comedies...especially the ones where I don't think I'll cry, but do anyway! What's the last movie that you watched? Would you like me to recommend a similar type of movie or a different type of movie genre? Seeker: the last movie I watched was groundhog day. Which is a romantic comedy so you could recommend something like that. Recommender: Sorry for the delay! I have a recent romantic comedy that was out in the theaters this past year...it's called Yesterday. Is this one that you've seen? Seeker: Oh yes I have seen Yesterday but I did really like it and I would be willing to watch again! So I accept your recommendation! Recommender: Wow! I'm really impressed that you saw that movie; a lot of people that I know didn't see it. I did cry at some point in that movie. I thank you for accepting my recommendation! Too bad we don't probably live in the same area, since I'm always looking for a movie buddy! Seeker: Yes it is not a very popular movie but I very much enjoyed it! I too am always looking for a movie buddy i hope you find one! Recommender: Have a great day! Seeker: Why do you think not many people have seen Yesterday? Recommender: Good question. Maybe it wasn't advertised as widely as it should have been. The leading guy, who's adorable, probably isn't considered a big box office draw, like Brad Pitt. It seemed to be more of an independent little art-house type romantic comedy, if that makes sense. Now I want to re-watch it! Did the movie make you tear up? Seeker: It totally made me tear up! I especially loved the part where he met the other people who also remembered the beatles songs. And when he went to meet john lennon! Recommender: Ohhhh, yes. I just got chills! Shall I recommend another movie or do you feel comfortable with where we are in our conversation? Seeker: You could recomend another movie but I am also comfortable where we are - up to you Recommender: What about Notting Hill? Seeker: Oh thats another great movie I don't think I've watched that for about 10 years!",

Seeker: The last movie we watched was Ready or Not, which is like a horror movie but kind of funny? Lots of blood and the characters who were the seekers in the movie (they were playing deadly hide and seek) were all idiots, and the girl kept getting away. I really liked how despite it being a scary movie, there was comedic relief scattered throughout. I did not like this one seen where the girl who was supposed to be hiding really hurt her hand... it was really graphic and made my stomach hurt a little... Recommender: Do you want a movie with a similar story or a different one? Seeker: Yes, a similar one please :) Recommender: I remember you said you like action movies but it looks like ya'll like horror movies instead. Seeker: We like both, but I would say that Ready or Not had some action moments too. You asked me about the most recent movie we saw and it just happened to be the most recent.

Especially the midcredit scene :P Recommender: I hate when that happens it seems like the sequel is always less exciting than the first.

If you like movie like A Quiet Place then I can definitely make some recommendations. Seeker: Yes please! I would like that. Recommender: What did you like about A Quiet Place? Seeker: I did like the fact about staying quiet while trying to live among these creatures. Recommender: OKay let's find some trailers similar to that. Seeker: Please find some suitable trailers for me. Recommender: Have you seen 10 Cloverfield Lane? Seeker: Yes I have! And loved that movie. Recommender: That would be my top pick, but since you've seen it... how about Annihilation? with Natalie Portman? Seeker: I have not seen Annihilation!, would you recommend this movie? Recommender: I would. It's similar to A Quiet Place but different enough to be interesting so you dont feel like youre watching the same movie again. It's less focused on the quiet elements but features a good bit of mysterious fantasy creatures and a general sci-fi mystery plot Seeker: I do accept this recommendation and can not wait to see. Thank you very much! Recommender: You'll like it. But if I may make another suggestion. Don't Breathe is also great within this genre. This title would be more of a suspenseful, quiet, with lots of scares and a less involved plot. Seeker: I can view the first recommendation and look into this other Don't Breathe as the next movie to watch. Thank you so much!",

Seeker: the last film that i watched was Jojo rabbit. im kind of tired of the marvel movies. i feel like its the same film every time i watch it. i like a movie that makes me think theres going to be more.i like cold endings where the viewer can guess what happens next and it changes on what the viewer sees. like in the grey where he fights the wolf in the end it doesnt show who wins but it is up to the viewer to guess Recommender: Ok I understand. If movies with cold endings are your thing, have you ever seen the film Doubt? Seeker: whos in it and what is it about? Recommender: The film stars Meryl Streep and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. The film is about A nun seeking answers to a mystery within the Church. Seeker: sounds pretty good. is it like spiritual mystery of criminal mystery? Recommender: A little of both actually. would you be interested in watching a trailer? Seeker: yeah sure! sounds right up my ally Recommender: ok great! Seeker: is the movie dark? like color wise? Recommender: Yes, but not too dark that you cant tell whats going on. Seeker: okay some movies get like that. is it a slow moving movie or one that goes pretty Quickly? like with the dark colors and slow moving stroy line you think that someone would fall asleep? im looking to watch one with my GF but she falls asleep often when i put a movie on Recommender: I completely understand where you're coming from. I personally feel the Mystery and intrigue are more than enough to keep viewers on their toes. Seeker: thats good to hear. i probably will end up watching it all. while i do accept the first recommendation. do you have one more for me since we are forced to stay inside for god knows how long?",

I lost a parent as a teenager so it hit hard. Seeker: Okay I definitely will go see that then!

I have wanted to see it but now I'm scared it might be a little too much, but I will still see it. So sorry about your loss as well.

It is about Edward Snowden an ex-CIA agent who showed the United States all of the vasts amounts of information they have on their citizens. You would love it! Check out the trailer. Seeker: Okay, sure I will check it out. Have you seen the movie 1917? The cinematography is supposed to be great. Recommender: No, but I have a couple of friends who went to go see it in the movies and said it was phenomenal! I should check it out if you're recommending it too, I will as a matter of fact. Seeker: Snowden is no longer on Netflix. Can you recommend another film to me? Comedy or spy film? Recommender: The Exception is another great movie, it IS on Netflix! It's about a German soldier during the onset of WWII who is sent to see if the Dutch resistance has planted a spy against a German emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm. Seeker: Oh cool. I think I will watch it. I recommend the film Oh Lucy with Josh Harnett that is on Hulu I think. It is about Japanese and American cultural differences. It is a drama-comedy that is good if you like quirky films. Recommender: I love those types of films! Funny thing is I'm super interested in Japanese culture, I find it so fascinating and some of the game shows they have on their TV are HILARIOUS! Haha, thank you for that recommendation! Seeker: Do you watch Terrace House, the TV show? Recommender: No, but I heard is was a Japanese reality show of some sort. Can you explain it to me? Seeker: It's like the 1990s' Real World that was on MTV but it is like a slow drama reality show with good audio and celebrity Japanese hosts who make funny commentaries. It's great if you want to learn more about Japanese culture. It's on Netflix. Thanks for the film recommendation of The Exception. I will check it out.",

I love comedies and since laughter is the best medicine, I'd like to find a family friendly comedy to lift my spirits. Recommender: Sure, have you seen Inside Out or CoCo? The creators have made another movie coming out soon. Seeker: No, I haven't seen either one. Any actors I would recognize in Inside Out? Recommender: Inside Out is an animated movie by Disney, It's definitely family friendly, not really a comedy Seeker: That sounds like an excellent recommendation! Thank you! Hope you have a nice weekend, goodbye :) Recommender: Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Richard Kind are among the cast Seeker: Amy Poehler is a hoot! Recommender: I really like the movie, very easy to relate. Definitely gives you that warm feeling afterward. Seeker: Is CoCo animated as well? Recommender: Yes, it is. Seeker: Would you say their are morals/lessons learned targeted towards children in one or both of these? Recommender: I would say so. In my opinion, Inside out shows children that it is normal to have crazy mixture of emotion during stressful times. The key is to have good communication with people you trust. Coco shows the importance of family and tradition. Seeker: I personally feel that it is very important that children know that it's okay to 'feel' different ways. I'm leaning towards watching Inside Out first. What year was that released? Recommender: I agree. It was released in 2015 Seeker: Would you happen to know if either of these films are currently offered on Netflix?",

Yes, I would like to watch this trailer. Recommender: Of course mate. Please enjoy it I have seen it like 5 times or more haha. It'll absolutely hold your attention and Mr. Smith is awesome. Have a great rest of your day and I hope my advise leads you to another classic you love. Take Care, J Seeker: Thanks again! Have a good one :) Recommender: Hey I think I can actually send this trailer to you if you would like? Seeker: Actually that would be very helpful, if you don't mind. Thanks! Recommender: Of course.

Recommender: Awesome. What kind of movies are you interested in seeing? Seeker: Actually I love adventure Recommender: I do too! Very entertaining. what was the last adventure film you watched? Seeker: I just had to re-watch Polar all over again last week Recommender: I didn't see that one yet but Jonas Akerlund directed that and I love his work. He also makes great music videos. Seeker: Yeah, he is a great director. I loved his Lords of chaos as well Recommender: SO movie that reminds me somewhat of Polar (what I've heard of it) that I thought was excellant is Atomic Blonde, starring Charlize Theron and James McAvoy. It takes place in Berlin during the cold war revolving around double agents. It's great. Great action scenes, intriguing story line, great music seleciton and cinematography. The trailer is definitely worth a watch. Seeker: Oh, that sounds intriguing. I'd love to see that one pretty soon. I love the sound of cold war as the story-line. I think I'd love it Recommender: Oh awesome! Seeker: Nice one then....I think my next movie is Atomic Blonde Recommender: Yeah it is a great film to watch especially as I imagine you won't have much to do in the coming weeks!

It also stars Jennifer Aniston and has many comedic moments. Seeker: Oh wow, I've never heard of it but that sounds like something I'd be interested in. I'll have to check it out.

It's nice to dig up old obscure movies, especially since I've seen too much Netlflix Seeker: That's true. I'm always looking for new things to watch. Are there any other movies you would suggest? Recommender: Goon on Netflix is a low-budget comedy movie about a hockey player. It did very poorly at the box office but it's now a cult classic. Seeker: That's a good one, I saw that a while back. I thought it was pretty good but I could see why the ratings wouldn't be great. I still haven't seen the second one. Recommender: I've seen about half of it. Pretty funny, same characters.

They got Celine Dion to banter with him, and it's hilarious! Seeker: I bet it is. I havent seen it yet. Can you tell me if ryan reynalds is in it? Recommender: Yes, he is the main character, Deadpool. He has a few other actors supporting him, and they are all very funny. It was one of the best reviewed movies with him in it!

Recommender: That can often be the case with some series. Like Men in Black, I still think the 1st was the best. Seeker: Same here Recommender: What do you think is next on your list to see? I think I am waiting for Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker. Seeker: That's probably going to be my next, unless my wife can talk me into Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.

I too have many close seconds, but the story in Shawshank Redemption is just great to me. Hard to find movies today that are just a great story and not all action and graffics. Seeker: Yes, I love that movie too. Also Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan (big Tom Hanks fan) Recommender: Yes. Tom Hanks has been great in a variety of rolls.

I think people tend to focus more on the effects than the actual movie. I think a good rom com or a good mystery.

I'd like to see that movie. I've heard there's a twist, but I don't know what it is. Recommender: i really dont want to spoiled it for you, it really looks good, now on to mistery. This holiday season brings a couple of suspense flicks to the screen: one of them is Knives out. with a current score of 98% on rotten tomatoes it is sure to be a hit Seeker: I saw that one already.

Seeker: Yes, it sounds like a good movie. Recommender: excellent, i hope you enjoy the trailer Seeker: Thanks. What I've seen has been good so far. Recommender: here is a little sniped of the movie Seeker: Huh? I don't see the link. What happened to it? Recommender: Kate is a young woman subscribed to bad decisions. Her last date with disaster? That of having accepted to work as Santa's elf for a department store. However, she meets Tom there. Her life takes a new turn. For Kate, it seems too good to be true. Seeker: Do they say in the movie why she's so inclined to bad decisions? Recommender: she(Emilia Clarke) just seem to make bad decision after another. Part of the whole Rom Com thing i guess. Seeker: Is it super cheesy like most rom coms, with some speech to a bunch of random people, that most people wouldn't do in real life? Recommender: no it really seams to be a good movie, the cast is good and the truth is that movies like this only are good around Christmas. i hope you enjoy your movie Seeker: Do you have any other good recommendations?",

Honestly i would try and look at this movie detached from the batman franchise completely. Even tho its does have easter eggs for those fans this is way to good to even lump with them. If you're familiar with Joaquin Phoenix expect a quality that only he can achieve. It a performance for sure. Not like health ledger way more real. Seeker: EXCELLENT!! you had me sold when you said Suicide squad was garbage! I accept your recommendation. I saw the Director also said to watch it as a completely independent movie as well. Is this movie friendly for the more religious side of ones family? I have a few Zealots and want to know what too expect so I can stave off their constant state of being offended lol. Recommender: I don't remember any direct talk of any religion really. But i am biased i'm pretty agnostic so i dont watch for it much. I'd be more worried about becoming anarchist after watching it then any religious aspect. Seeker: Noted. Well I certainly appreciate the recommendation! Any other last second recommendations?

The original movie was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. Would you like to look at any of the other movies in the series? Seeker: Well of course im going to look at all of them Recommender: Great! I recommend starting with the first film. The duration is only 142 minutes, so it won't take up your whole afternoon that way you can still have time to decide if you want to get the other movies in the series.

I believe it would fit the genre of horror more than suspenseful, but I still found some suspense in the plot. Recommender: It does fit the horror genre, but also fits suspenseful too. I have seen it, it is a good one. Have you watched the movie Bird Box yet? Seeker: No, I have not seen that film. Did you enjoy it? Recommender: I did enjoy it! Sandra Bullock is the main character, and it is quite suspenseful. Seeker: Fantastic, I will watch that one soon. Thank you for the recommendation. Recommender: Great! Would you like to watch the movie trailer for it? Seeker: Yes, that would be helpful. Recommender: I will make sure you can view the trailer for that movie. Seeker: Do you have any other recommendations for suspenseful films I can watch after Bird Box? Recommender: I do! Have you seen the new release of the re-done Pet Semetary yet? Seeker: I have not, but I liked the original one. I will watch that after Bird Box, thank you!",

Recommender: I recently watched a movie starring Sean Connery called Medicine Man, it's about a researcher living in the jungle who thinks he has found a cure for cancer. At the same time, businesses are destroying the jungle. Mostly drama, I thought it was pretty good. Seeker: Nice, I'll have to check that one out. Recommender: An older movie, 1992. Also starring Lorraine Bracco. The chemistry between Lorraine Bracco and Sean Connery is kind of funny. Seeker: Oh ok, I've heard of her as well. I'm a huge sean connery fan so I'll definitely have to find that one as well. Thanks! Recommender: I hope you enjoy it. The scenery is going to be quite different than that of Finding Forrester. Mostly takes place in the rain forest, I believe somewhere in South America. The two scientists are pretty isolated.

I will not spoil it, but much of the story includes love, the Vietnam War, and fame. I really think you would love this movie! Seeker: Oh Alabama...? In what year does the movie take place? Are there aspects of racism within the film? Recommender: The movie begins with Forrest as a boy during the 1950's then takes you throughout his life until about 1980. There are aspects of racism within the film that do coincide with some of the negative views that took place during those times. The film absolutely does not agree with any of the negative views that some characters exemplify.
