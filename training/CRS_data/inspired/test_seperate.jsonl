Since I remembered some of your preferences for movies are animation and comic based, I thought this would be something unique for you. Plus there's a lot of funny adult-oriented humor. Although, there's not so much horror since they just break into a bunch of little Lego pieces when they get obliterated.",

            "That sounds interesting. Who are some of the actors in that movie?",
