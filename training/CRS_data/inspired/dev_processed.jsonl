What were the last two movies you watched with them? Seeker: Toy Story 4 and Endgame Recommender: Endgame was an excellent movie. I am very excited to see some of the upcoming Marvel movies. Are your kids fans of Marvel Super Heros? Seeker: Yes they all. They also like DC Recommender: That's awesome! I think a good movie for you to check out with them would be the upcoming movie called Black Widow. It has Scarlett Johansson making a return from the Avengers movies as the Black Widow in her own story about being an agent of SHIELD and how she came to get there. It reveals more about her history and is expected to be one of the top ranking movies featuring a female super hero. It comes out in May 2020. Would you like to see the trailer for this? Seeker: Yes, that sounds awesome Recommender: Perfect, while I gather the link from that movie trailer tell me which super heros are your kids favorite and I may be able to find additional recommendations for you. Seeker: We have seen all the rest of the super heros movies on the Marvel side. Recommender: Well great, then this upcoming trailer is the perfect match for you. Seeker: Thank you very much can't wait to see it Recommender: My apologies, trailer availability is limited at this time and we seem to be out of this particular link. I highly recommend Joker trailer since your kids are also fans of DC. Would you like to see this one since we are not in stock of the other? I do apologize again for that error.

I don't know a lot of directors by name, but I think the stuff I've seen Taika Waititi work on has been pretty funny.

It is probably a chance that Walter is still alive. But thank you so much for your suggestion and recommendation, I greatly appreciate it. Recommender: I am glad I could help you find something you are interested in! If they do more Alien movies I will be there to watch them for sure. It was no problem at all. Pumpkinhead really is a great movie. I hope you enjoy it! Seeker: Thanks again. I will I'm sure I will. Recommender: I have found the trailer I believe Seeker: Oh goody...!! I most definitely will! Nice chatting with you! Recommender: You too Seeker: Do you have any additional recommendations? Recommender: Now that you mention it I do! Seeker: Hmm....awesome. Hit me with them because I want to find something new and different. I've seen the Avengers, including Halloween, Maleficent with Angelina Jolie, Gretel and Hansel (Not the new movie but the TV Syfy version), Jaws (all of them), Halloween (all of them except for the very last one), all of the Underworld movies, I've seen a LOT of movies including all of the Jeepers Creepers movies. We can go way back to The Omen movies, and movies with Vincent Price! Recommender: You really do have great taste in movies. The Halloween and Jeepers Creepers movies are some of my all time favorite series. If you would like to go old school I would suggest House Of Wax Seeker: House of Wax? Thats a great movie. I've seen it but I would watch it again.", "rec": [], "resp": "It is a great movie. I'm glad to hear you would watch it again. Would you like to watch the movie trailer?"}

Seeker: I really like fantasy and science fiction movies with aliens and futuristic technology. Recommender: Awesome. So are movies like Terminator and the Star Wars franchise movies that you have indulged in? Seeker: I've seen most of the Terminator series and *all* of the Star Wars movies! Have you heard of any others like them? Recommender: I haven't, but I really enjoyed the sci-fi nature of The Matrix. Seeker: The Matrix was good, the sequels not so much. I find the different visions of humanity's future interesting even when they are distopian. Recommender: I agree!
