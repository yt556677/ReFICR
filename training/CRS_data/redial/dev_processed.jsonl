Award winning I think Seeker: A great film to watch and be carried away from the busy life. Recommender: These are two good suggestions. Zero Days (2016) sounds like the winner Seeker: Another suggestion is The Darkest Hour (2011) which is about Winston Churchill I just finished watching. Amazing is all I can say. I think the year is wrong it barely came out last year. Is there anything else I can help you with? Recommender: I have that movie. It was good. Seeker: I am glad I can help.
