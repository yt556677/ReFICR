Recommender: I have heard so much about the Die hard franchise but I've never seen all of them I've seen Looper, it was alright. Seeker: If you are in the mood for a good story Pan's Labyrinth (2006) is a real kicker. Recommender: That movie was amazing. I love the creatures in it. Such an amazingly put together movie. Any others like that? Seeker: Die Hard Franchise was great back in the day. Die Hard 2 (1990) and Live Free or Die Hard (2007) are half decent. Other's like Pan's Labyrinth (2006) that I can think off that is similar would be The Lord of the Rings (1978) or The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) I agree Pan's Labyrinth (2006) was awesome! Recommender: Oh boy. Lord of the rings is like something I would avoid. Way too long for me plus I'm not a fan of the books so I'd fall asleep. I would probably only watch for Orlando Bloom.

It's sad, but I still think it has a feel-good aspect at the end seeing her grow old. Seeker: How about Pretty Woman (1990) that's a classic? Recommender: If only she could have moved over a bit on that piece of wood. LOL Seeker: I really enjoyed Love Actually (2003) LMBO! Recommender: Oh, yes! Love Pretty Woman (1990) , and I haven't seen it in awhile. Seeker: Another fave for me is Dirty Dancing Recommender: Is Love Actually (2003) the Christmas movie? I'm trying to remember... Seeker: Yes, it is. Recommender: LOVE the scene where the boy goes to stop his girl in the airport. And, Dirty Dancing . Patrick Swayze...That's all you have to say and I love it. :) It's great.

Only because alot of lines from it are stuck in my head If you dont like animated stuff I rewatched John Wick (2014) recently have you seen it? Recommender: No I haven't. Know something a little more mature but not so crude with humor? I'm okay with animated though. Seeker: I saw The Usual Suspects (1995) for the first time last week, it wasn't half bad Recommender: It took you 23 years to see it? Seeker: 0_0 never was a fan of action movies. Didn;t think I HAD to watch it lol Recommender: You didn't HAVE to do so. I'm joking. Seeker: There are probably many classics that I've never seen but I'll check em out eventually. But this is not about me. Whats one of your favs? Recommender: Seen Law Abiding Citizen (2009). The Usual Suspects (1995) sounds similar. Seeker: :) Ok cool Recommender: I like The Boxtrolls (2014), Rush Hour (1998), and Life (1996) just to name a few. Seeker: Awesome. Hope you choose one of these to enjoy. I might check out a few of them myself Recommender: I'm feeling childish, so I think I will check out Shrek (2001). There's not too many fart jokes in it, is it? Eddie Murphy better be worth it. Seeker: Like one fart joke but it's more than just the frat boy humor and Shrek 2 (2004) is awesome as well Hope you like it Recommender: Okay. I hope I do as well. Thanks.

I think he might be pretty uncomfortable There is also 2 more parts Fifty Shades Darker (2017) and Fifty Shades Freed (2018) Recommender: Yes, I've seen it. I haven't seen the other two though. It's not the best movie, but it was okay. Seeker: I actually liked Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) . I watched Fifty Shades Darker (2017) with my husband and he was uncomfortable. Recommender: That's funny. Seeker: I agree with you Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) is defiantly not worth watching again Recommender: Why in particular was he uncomfortable? Seeker: What about Borat (2006) . Maybe this will work In other hands Borat (2006) was making me more uncomfortable, not my husband Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) is basically a movie for girls. He didn't like it and he said it was dumb . lol Recommender: Have you seen How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003) or Fatal Attraction (1987)? Seeker: I saw How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003) . I liked it. I haven't seen Fatal Attraction (1987) . Did you like it? Is it worth watching? Recommender: If you're in the mood for revenge, Shakespeare style. Seeker: Google says that Gone Girl (2014) might be uncomfortable to watch together. Bit I don;t know why. I loved Gone Girl (2014) Gone Girl (2014) is exactly about the revenge! Maybe you should go with this one Recommender: Maybe because she fakes her own death, right? Is there a bit of mystery or suspense in Gone Girl (2014)? Seeker: Yes by I can't say it's uncomfortable. Not to me I Guess ) There is for sure a lot of mystery in Gone Girl (2014) Recommender: Alright I like that idea. I'm going with Gone Girl (2014)!", "rec": [], "resp": "I hope you'll enjoy!
